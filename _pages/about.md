Hi ! I am Mathieu Le Breton, from Grenoble, France. I'm working as applied scientist in the company Géolithe, a consulting firm on natural risks.  I am investigating methods to monitor the near-surface (landslides and snowpack) with passive geophysics and wireless passive sensors. Here are some research publications.
